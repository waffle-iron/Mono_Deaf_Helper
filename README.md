# MonoDeafHelper
ğŸ‘Œ ğŸ‘Œ This is project where I try to explore macOS app development ğŸ‘Œ ğŸ‘Œ<br/>
ğŸ‘‚ğŸ‘‚  Make quick access to mono/stereo output mode, when I am switching between Headphones and Speakers ğŸ‘‚ğŸ‘‚ <br/>
ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ Other thing is to make it as testable as possible ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ <br/>
